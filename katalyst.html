	<p>Hello!! My name is Romy kumari. I am an engineering student persuing computer science engineering from Bharati Vidyapeeths College of Engineering. I would like to share my experience with Katalyst. It may sound different, some will think like I may have misspelled the word catalyst as katalyst. The journey of b.tech was started in 2017. I was silently experiencing the college life and hardly trying to make good friends but due to lack of self-confidence I was not able to interact with anyone and even after 2 months, I barely talk to anyone. My only work was to woke up at 5am, reach college at 8:30am, attend classes and then leave. While all other classmates were busy in interacting with seniors I was struggling to talk even to my classmates. Truly speaking, for me interacting with someone was the hardest task. It's not like, I had not interacted with someone in past, the only thing was, I never initiated. Then one day while performing my experiment in workshop lab, our teacher called all of the girls and asked to tell the annual salary of family, I was very nervous because in these 2 months I was very sure that their lifestyle was very different from mine and may be one of the reason I felt myself to be different from them and not able to talk. And after writting down the annual salary of all the girls, result was the expected one, that was I am the one with lowest annual family income, though I was not embarrassed of it. Next day I was called in the conference room to attend some meeting, I was excited about what will happen next, that only I was going to experience from my class. In meeting I got to know about an organisation named <u>Katalyst</u>. They explained their programmes, opportunities and motive. That seems very fascinating because they mentioned thing like they will provide laptops, medical insurance and payouts as a scholarship to us but on the other hand it sound unreal like why will anyone provide these facilities to us without getting any benefits from us. First of all, as I was a science student and love chemistry, for me the name "katalyst" was not appropriate, it should be catalyst. </p>
<p>Finally in November 2017, we had a induction on November 2017 which was a well organised event , we got the chance to meet poorvi mam and Meenakshi mam. They are so humble and caring, they clarified each and every doubt about the institution and more interestingly we got to know that each year they organise the annual convention in Goa. At that moment only one question was roaming in my mind- " Is there any possibility that I will get the chance to attend the Goa convention". For me it was like a dream, I never thought of being at Goa that too during my college days. They specified all the eligibility criteria that need to be fulfilled to attend Goa convention. Till that moment I made my mind to join katalyst, not because I want to but due to Goa convention.</p>
<p>I still remember we had our first class on 18 December on personality development by Gopal sir. One may get surprised by the fact  that how can I remember all these dates, this is because I had my last exam of first semester on this day and I had travelled one hour after appearing in my exam in order to attend the training. Training went quite well. We had many different activities like sketching, games and question answer session. On the very first day of training I had won the first game for my team consisting of 5 members and we had clicked a picture of the team which is still the wallpaper of my laptop. It was fun to be a part of katalyst till now. Then the training on different topics including of technical and non-technical was scheduled for us every weekend and mentor was alloted to each and every girl. I was alloted 'sunanda mam'. I was very excited to meet her as I was the first one to get the mentor. But unfortunately mam met with an accident and we were not able to meet for almost two months. But finally I got a chance to meet her at her home. She called me at her house to have an interaction. That was the first interaction so we had tried to know each other expectations from katalyst. But due to lack of understanding and interaction I had been alloted 'Gopali mam' as my mentor. She is from Mumbai and she is really an awesome lady. I am still in touch with her. She keeps on trying her best to make thing happen for me. For example- once I asked her for help in coding and interview skills, she assured me that she will help me out. But as she is in Mumbai we cannot interact so often.  We loose our connection due to sudden demise of her father and it was not appropriate to ask about that. We had not connected in about 5 months but one day I got a call from mam, she is so humble, she apologized for not being in contact although it was my mistake too. She asked me to take Accenture learning session that she developed for me. I was so overwhelmed when I got to hear this. This made me felt, how awesome mentor I have. She is my mentor but we cannot interact face to face so to solve this problem, katalyst provided me one more
 <a href="mentor.html">mentor</a>- "Subhash sir". I had met him many times as katalyst girl but not as his mentee. I started having face to face interaction with him. In first interaction he accessed my abilities and the result was so right and to the point. He is so helping and always available. Recently, on 26 january we had a visit to petrol pump for flag hosting which was a memorable experience. Katalyst provided me two mentors which keep on guiding me toward my goals. </p>
<p>Katalyst not only provided me with the great mentors but also arranged so many valuable trainings which made me realize that joining katalyst is one of the best decision I have taken in my life. I got the opportunity to visit IIT, interact with IIT girls. I had some memorable memories too like Goa convention and most importantly I made many friends here, like soumya, Sakshi, Mitu, and many more. I got to know about my seniors also. I am no longer a person with lack of self-confidence. After attending so many trainings, I can openly talk to anybody without the fear of getting judged. Katalyst helps me in identifying me. Initially I never wanted to lead or participate in any activity but now, I have the courage to not only participate in that but also act as a leader in the team. I want to thank katalyst for making me want I wanted to.</p>
<p>I joined katalyst for having fun but it changed my life. Katalyst made me a different person. From a diffident personality to a confident person. Katalyst provided me the courage to do whatever I wanted to. I should give a try to things I wanted to, nothing will change, either I will win or I will gain experience there is nothing called failure. And at the end I wanted to say 'cataylst' or "katalyst" both help in formation of the end product in which our mentors helps us in reducing the activation energy to complete the reaction.</p>
